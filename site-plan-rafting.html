      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        [Too often, big guys are not allowed to do fun things, becuase of their
        size. No longer will big guys be too big or too tall to go on rafting
        trips with the boys. Our size will not define our adventures. ]
      </p>
      <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        [This site is for the big boys. Anyone who is 6ft plus, anyone that is
        200lbs plus. We will not be excluded from enjoying the fun adventures
        mother nature has in store for us. No longer will small canvas rafts be
        compromised by our large manly size. ]

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
